# Individual project python tasks
This repository contains python elementary tasks from IT academy courses.
# Application conditions
**Chessboard** - program creates and shows chessboard after user inputting from the keyboard length and width.

**Digits2text** - program convert numbers which inputted as digits and translate in text representation.

**Happy tickets** - program helps to understand which of 2 methods:\
 Simple - if a six-digit number is printed on the ticket, and the sum of the first three digits is equal to the sum of the last three. \
 Complicated - if the sum of the even numbers of the ticket is equal to the sum of the odd numbers of the ticket.\
 Which of this two methods can fond more happy tickets in range which is chosen by user.
 
 **Numeric Sequences** - program prints a comma-separated row of length consisting from natural numbers whose square is not less than a given number.
 
 **Fibonacci** - program prints all Fibonacci numbers that satisfy the constraint passed to the function:
- in the specified range or;
- have the specified length.

**Palindrome** - program checks if the number or its part is a palindrome.

**Triangle** - Create a console program that performs the output of triangles in descending order.
their area.\
After adding each new triangle, the program asks if user add one more.\
If the user answers “y” or “yes” (case insensitive),the program will ask you to enter data for another triangle, otherwise it displays result in the console.
- the calculation of the area of a triangle should be set using the Heron formula;
- input format (comma separated): <Name>, <side_1>, <side_2>, <side_3>;
- an application must handle floating point numbers.
  
**File parser** - program will have two modes:
- read the number of occurrences of a line in a text file;
- replace the string with another in the specified file.

# Installation
To run the program code from a file, you need to start working with Python3 and get access to the Python interpreter. Python is available on the Python Software Foundation https://www.python.org website. On website you need to download Python interpreter version 3.6 or higher.
Also, please use pytest for the test execution.
Before running any command, please install pytest, type in terminal:
**pip install pytest**
